=head1 Purpose

A few years ago, my son needed a stopwatch for a science fair project.  I wrote
one using gtkmm.  I lost that code, but thought it made a good base for an
example project.  I've recreated it in this project.  While I think this
stopwatch works fine, I expect most people to already have access to a
perfectly good stopwatch on their phone.  Many people probably have access
to more than one.

Instead this project serves only as a demo of how I think about GUI
programming.  The code has never relied on inheritance the way that many GUI
tutorials do.  If nothing else, this project shows that it is possible to
implement a project in gtkmm without inheriting from C<Gtk::Window> or other
widgets.

=head1 Tests

Unfortunately, this is the kind of code that doesn't lend itself to tests.
Once you strip out the UI-related code, most of what's left involves asking
for a current point in time, and determining how much time has elapsed since an
earlier point.  I love tests, but I don't see a good way to include them in
this project.
